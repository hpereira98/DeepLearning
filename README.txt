## Class 1: PimaIndiansDiabetes
The Pima are a group of Native Americans living in Arizona. 
A genetic predisposition allowed this group to survive normally to a diet poor of carbohydrates for years. 
In the recent years, because of a sudden shift from traditional agricultural crops to processed foods, together with a decline in physical activity, made them develop the highest prevalence of type 2 diabetes and for this reason they have been subject of many studies.

The original dataset is available at UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be downloaded from this address: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes .

More info on the dataset can be found on the PimaIndiansDiabetes folder.
